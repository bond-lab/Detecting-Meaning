<h1>HG8011: Detecting Meaning with Sherlock Holmes</h1>

<p> There are two projects, each worth 20%, with the second building
  on the first.  If you do not do the first, you cannot do the second,
  and lose 40% of your marks!  The due dates for each project are
  given on the <a href='index.html'>main page</a>.


<h3><a name='phase1'>Project 1: Lexical Semantic Analysis with a Semantic Network (20%)</a></h3>

<p>Annotate (on your own) all open class words in a short section of
    text, using an updated version of the IMI system (Bond et al,
    2015).  In this project please do not discuss your annotations
    with each other.

<ul>
  <li> If you have not done so already, read the story (at least up to
    the part you are assigned, preferably the whole story).
    This year we will look at
    the <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/canon/houn.html'>Hound
    of the Baskervilles</a>
    
  <li> Using the on-line tool provided annotate each open class word in
    a short (roughly 15 sentence) text.
    <!-- a short (roughly 20-30 sentence) text. -->
    
    <ul>
    <li> For each word you should chose one of the senses
      in <a href='https://wordnet.princeton.edu/'>wordnet</a>
      (Fellbaum 1998) or indicate why this is not possible.
    <li> There is a <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc-unipi/guide/simple.html'>quick start guide</a>.
    <li> More detailed instructions are
    given <a href='http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc-unipi/tagdoc.html'>on-line<a/>,
	read them.
    <li>The tool works best under Chrome or Firefox.
    <li><a href='annotate.html#phase1'>Your assigned sentences for the
    first part are here</a>
  </ul>
  <li> Estimated time 4-6 hours, don't overthink the tags
  <li>   You will be assessed on
    <ul>
      <li>Completion: is everything tagged
      <li>Accuracy: are the tags reasonable (do they agree more than
	a threshold with an expert annotation)
    </ul>
  <li> If you have tagged everything reasonably accurately then you will pass
  <li> Comment words where you are not sure of the tag, it will make
  the second project easier
</ul>

<h3><a name='phase2'>Project 2: Semantic Analysis &mdash; Comparison (20%)</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li> You will be given a comparison of your tags with those of other
    annotators and a merged corpus with the majority tags tagged.
      <br> I will announce when this is ready.
  <li>You should discuss any differences as a group 
  <li> You should re-tag any words on which there was no majority
    agreement, or on which you changed your mind.
  <li> If you mark something with <tt>e</tt> or <tt>w</tt> you should
  add a clear comment. If the same word appears multiple times, you
  only need to add a comment for the first occurrence.
  <li>Note that the final annotator is a naive computer
    &mdash; it just tags most frequent sense (mfs)
    <ul>
      <li>mfs is calculated from the semcor corpus and three Sherlock
	Holmes Stories (DANC, SPEC and REDH) weighted 1:3 to normalize frequencies
      <li>Unseen proper nouns are tagged as <tt>per</tt>
      <li>Unseen closed class words are tagged as <tt>x</tt>
      <li>Unseen monosemous words are tagged with their single sense
      <li>Other unseen words are tagged <tt>None</tt>
      <li>If there are two or more equally frequent senses for a lemma
	then it is tagged <tt>None</tt>
    </ul>
  <li>So feel free to over-ride this annotator!
  <li><a href='annotate.html#phase2'>Your assigned sentences for the
      second part are here</a>
  <li> Estimated time 4-6 hours.   The faster your connection and the
    bigger your screen, the easier it is.
  <li>   You will be assessed (as a group) on
    <ul>
      <li>Completion: is everything tagged
      <li>Accuracy: are the tags reasonable (do they agree more than
	a threshold with an expert annotation)
    </ul>
<li>If you cannot get any discussion from a member of your group, please let
  me know
</ul>

<!-- <h3>Phase 3: Write up</h3> -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li> In the write up you should describe the strengths and weaknesses  -->
<!--     of using a lexical resource such as wordnet to define word meaning -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--       <li> Are the senses in wordnet too coarse, too fine or just right?   -->
<!-- 	Justify your position. -->
<!--     </ul> -->
<!--   <li> You should give concrete examples from the text you analyzed. -->
<!--   Some things you could discuss include: -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--     <li> Were some words easier or harder to annotate than others? -->
<!--       <ul> -->
<!-- 	<li> e.g. verbs, multiword expressions, concrete nouns, … -->
<!--       </ul> -->
<!--     <li> In cases where you disagreed with other annotators, on -->
<!--     reflection, do you think: you were right; they were right; the -->
<!--     definition is bad; or is there some other reason? -->
<!--     </ul> -->
<!--   <li> For words with senses missing in wordnet, you should write a -->
<!--   comment with enough information to create a new entry for them -->
<!--   consisting of, at minimum, a definition, a relational link to an -->
<!--   existing synset and an example. E.g.   -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--       <li> Lemma: arrow -->
<!--       <li> Def: To assign a task to someone. Generally used only if the task is unpleasant or boring. -->
<!--       <li> Ex: They come and arrow me type their document -->
<!--       <li> Hyponym of: delegate (02391803-v) -->
<!--     </ul> -->
<!--   <li> You don't need an extensive literature review, but you should -->
<!--     read and cite  the references below and  if you -->
<!--     consult other lexicons (which you are encouraged to do) then you -->
<!--     should cite them.  You should also cite the wordnet you used and -->
<!--     the stroy you tagged. -->

<!--   <li> You should also discuss how long it took you to do the -->
<!--   annotation, and if you think there would be ways to make the task -->
<!--   quicker or easier. -->
<!--   <li>Formatted according to -->
<!--     the <a href='http://linguistics.hss.ntu.edu.sg/CurrentStudents/Documents/Guidelines%20to%20Submitting%20Written%20Work%20for%20the%20Division%20of%20Linguistics%20and%20Multilingual%20Studies.pdf'>LMS -->
<!--       guidelines</a> to submitting written work for the Division of LMS -->
<!--     (but see below). -->
<!--     <ul> -->
<!--       <li>You do not have to follow the suggested structure of "Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References."  A short introduction describing the task followed by Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References is enough. -->
<!--       <li>You should mention which corpus and which section you were annotating (e.g -->
<!--       Eng1: Sentence XXX to YYY) -->
<!--     </ul> -->
<!--   <li>If you want to make it even more beautiful, as I am sure you do, -->
<!--     take a look at my <a href = -->
<!-- 			 "http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/fcbond/data/ling-style.pdf">(Computational) -->
<!--       Linguistic Style Guidelines</a>: a guide for the flummoxed. -->
<!--   <li> Submit both <b>hardcopy</b> (stapled, two sided, no folder, no cover page) -->
<!--     and <b>softcopy</b> (via NTULearn). -->
<!--   <li> The deadline for the write up <b>23:59 Oct 31st</b>.   -->
<!-- </ul> -->
