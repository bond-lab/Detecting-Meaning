The Adventure of the Dancing
Men (1903)
 Holmes,

upholder of justice and drug addict?

 In

the Victorian era, “sale of opium, laudanum,
cocaine and morphine was legal. Victorian
users took these dangerous drugs as selfmedication and as recreation” (VW)*

 Holmes's

recreational use of drugs can be
explained in two ways.

The Adventure of the Dancing
Men (1903)
From A Study in Scarlet (1887):


Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him: but
now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie
upon the sofa in the sitting- room, hardly uttering a word or moving a
muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a
dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of
being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and
cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion. (The Complete
Sherlock Holmes, vol. I, 13)

From The Sign of Four (1890):


Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his
hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white,
nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left
shirt-cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy
forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks.
Finally, he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and
sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.
(The Complete Sherlock Holmes, vol. I, 99) [not unusual for heroes to have
fatal flaw—superman; more “relatable”)

The Adventure of the Dancing
Men
(1903)
The introduction
of Holmes “his long, thin back curved over a


chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous
product.”


“If there is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should do
well to take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to
finish, and this investigation draws rapidly to a close.”



Holmes brilliant or because others around him lack the skills of
close observation?



The drawings of the Dancing Men.



Why are they not described in the narrative but illustrated?



Hilton Cubitt’s family background:

“You'll just ask me anything that I don't make clear. I'll begin at the
time of my marriage last year; but I want to say first of all that,
though I'm not a rich man, my people have been at Ridling Thorpe for
a matter of five centuries, and there is no better-known family in the
county of Norfolk.”

The Adventure of the Dancing

“I am only
a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not a
Men
(1903)
man in England who ranks his family honour more
highly than I do.”



The significance of Elsie Patrick.



The marriage as irrational:

You'll think it very mad, Mr Holmes, that a man of a
good old family should marry a wife in this fashion,
knowing nothing of her past or of her people…


Holmes not simply a character that makes the
characters from prominent families look foolish, he
preserves their reputations.

The Red-Headed League
(1891)
 The

credible narrator credible?

Holmes: “I know, my dear Watson, that you
share my love of all that is bizarre and outside
the conventions and humdrum routine of
everyday life. You have shown your relish for it
by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to
chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying
so, somewhat to embellish so many of my
own little adventures.”
 The

effect of Holmes’ remark on the reader.

+
The Red-Headed League
(1891)
 Structural similarities in the stories; Holmes’
observations, often perceived as genius, often
downplayed.
 Very

much of the construction of the “genius”
Holmes also attributed to Holmes’ knowledge
of just about everything.

 The

ad that Wilson responded to first
published in The Morning Chronicle.

 Calling

attention to the “chronicle” or
“chronicling”; that which is factual /
invented.

The Red-Headed League
(1891)


Depiction of John Clay.



“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,'
remarked our prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his
wrists. 'You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my
veins. Have the goodness also when you address me always to
say “sir” and “please”.”



Depiction of Peter Jones:

“This fellow Merryweather is a bank director and personally
interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us
also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his
profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog,
and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone.
Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”

+
The Red-Headed League
(1891)


Holmes never has any problems of his own—his life
boring but made exciting by his clients’ “little
problems.”



“l'Homme n'est Rien l'Oeuvre Tout” (the man is
nothing, the work is everything” misquoted.
