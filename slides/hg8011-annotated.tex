\section{An online edition of the Canon}


\myslide{The Adventure of the Readable Texts}
\MyLogo{In the 2017 Beaten Annual, work done with Arthur Bond}
For my students (for this class), I wanted texts

\begin{itemize}
\item faithful to the original
\item easy to read on various devices
\item  aesthetically pleasing
\item linked to the rich world of information of the Great 
Game  
\end{itemize}

Sadly, no one site has given us what we want, so like many
before us, we ended up producing our own.  


\myslide{Data! Data! Data!}
\MyLogo{\eng{“Data! data! data!” he cried impatiently. “I can't make bricks
  without clay.”} \SHA{COPP}{The Adventure of the Copper Beeches (ACD 1892)}}
First, I took a look at what was already out there:

\myslide{Selection Criteria}
\MyLogo{
  \textit{‘It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.’}
A Case of Identity}

\begin{itemize}
\item Useful Metadata: When and where published, Author, Copyright,
  \ldots
\item Annotation:  links to TV and film
versions, chronologies, definitions of words and Sherlockian
scholarship
\item Spoilers!  Does the annotation reveal the villain?
\item Font: Is it a nice serif font (like in the Strand Magazine)
\item Resizability: can you read it on your phone
\item Pictures: does it have the illustrations nicely embedded?
\item Miscellaneous:  does it have search?

\end{itemize}

Every site had some good points, but no one is perfect.

\myslide{Our Approach}
\MyLogo{\textit{‘There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.’}
A Study in Scarlet}
\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/fcbond/sh-canon/}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Resizable, nice font with tufte-css
\item Full table of contents, linked from each story
\item Metadata in the margin: the date and place of publication, story
  number, which collection, \textit{date of action?}
\item Illustrations in the text\todo 
  % \begin{itemize}
  % \item From the Victorian web (more available)
  % \end{itemize}
\item Links to annotation at the end
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Wikipedia
  \item Arthur Conan Doyle Encylopedia
  \item Bill Dolan's Study Guide
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Annotation (new + ToDo)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Locations link to google maps
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What should we do for made-up places?\task
  \item Should link locations to geonames\todo
  \end{itemize}
\item Currency links to amount in today's currency
  \\ done for \sh{SPEC}
\item Person + Organization should link to entry in ACD Encylopedia
\item  Texts are searchable with a site-specific google search
  \\ metadata is hidden from indexing by the \texttt{<!--googleoff: all-->} command.
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Annotation ToDo}

 \begin{itemize}
  \item The sense level annotations of the \textit{NTU Multilingual Corpus}, which links each open class word to its definition in Wordnet%\footnote{{http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ntumc/cgi-bin/showcorpus.cgi}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We can also show translations and/or hypernyms
    \end{itemize}
  \item Content level annotation like the Annotated Sherlock Holmes

  \item We have syntactic annotation (treebanks) for \textit{The Adventure of the Speckled Band} which it would be good to display for those who are interested

  \item More from the \href{http://www.beaconsociety.com/}{Beacon
      Society}'s award winners, including information about word
    meaning, rhetorical devices, \ldots

  \item Links to facsimiles of the original stories

\end{itemize}

\myslide{Translations and Glosses}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Canon has been widely translated: we would like to also
  prepare editions of foreign languages, and consider the issue of
  linking the translations.  E.g.,   \href{https://inlector.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/the-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes/}{\textit{InLéctor}},
  who have produced a nice bilingual English-Spanish edition of
  \textit{The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes}.

\item With the multilingual wordnets, we can present glosses of the
  correct sense, in any of 34 languages (although not all will be
  complete)

\item We can investigate how to choose the words to highlight
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Low frequency (rare) word
  \item Lower frequency sense of a word (uncommon meaning)
  \item No direct translation --- give definition
  \item Word selected by e.g., Bill Dolan, my students, \ldots
  \end{itemize}
 it is quite hard to do this nicely, ... 

\end{itemize}

\myslide{Some Technical Issues}

\begin{itemize}
\item There is a lot of duplication in online resources (and I have
  only made it worse)

\item How can we share information?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Put the code and meta-data on github
\begin{verbatim}
SPEC	PUBLISHED	The Strand Magazine in February 1892
SPEC	ORDER	10
SPEC	COLLECTION	The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
SPEC	DORN	http://www.beaconsociety.com/uploads/3/7/3/8/37380505/dorn_spec_study_guide.pdf
SPEC	TITLE	The Adventure of the Speckled Band
SPEC	IMAGE	She lifted her veil	104.jpg
\end{verbatim}
    are there standard ways to refer to lines? 
  \end{itemize}
\item Is everyone happy to share information?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We have to make sure not to use data without permission
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


% \myslide{Acknowledgements}

% We would like to thank the Sound of the Baskervilles for their
% encouragement and advice; Alexis Barquin of the Arthur Conan Doyle
% Encyclopedia, who kindly allowed us to access his database of texts;
% and the makers of all the many editions we read --- we learned
% something from all of them.


\myslide{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item We now have some stories with every (open-class) word linked to
  an entry in a dictionary, and its grammatical category \\ What else can
  we do with this?
\item For \sh{SPEC} we also have this in Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian,
  Italian (and are working on Abui, Bulgarian, Dutch, Spanish and
  Polish).  And these are linked to the English
  \\ What we can do with this?
\item If you have any ideas (or want the data, or want to help me make
  more) please let me know.

\end{itemize}



\myslide{The Canon for Learners}

There are some nice versions annotated for non-English speakers.


\includegraphics[trim={0 48cm 0 16cm},clip,width=\textwidth]{pics/IMAG0172}



\myslide{The Canon for Learners: problems}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emp{BUT}, the glosses are not very good.  The correct sense is not
  highlighted (or sometimes even listed)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{cane} --- whip$_v$; reed$_n$, \ul{cane$_n$}
    \item \textbf{cast} ---  throw$_v$, make forms$_v$, send out$_v$,
      cast ou$_v$t; metal cast$_n$, form$_n$
      \\ should be \eng{cast one's eyes} ``take a quick look''
    \item \textbf{crane} --- mechanical crane
      \\ should be \eng{Crane Water} ``place name''
    \item \textbf{masonry} --- ``The occupation or work of a mason''
      \\ should be \eng{stonework}
  \end{itemize}
\item It is not clear how the words are selected
\\ Why not \textbf{dog-cart, homely, spring up, stump}?
\item With our sense tags we can do better than this!
\end{itemize}



\section{Teaching through Tagging}

\myslide{Teaching Meaning to my Students}
\MyLogo{some of the things I make/let my students do}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
\item Read a Sherlock Holmes story
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  So far \sh{SPEC}, \sh{DANC}, \sh{REDH} and \sh{SCAN}
\\ (also news, essays and Japanese short stories)
  \end{itemize}
\item Look at every content word
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Find its meaning in a dictionary (wordnet)
  \item Or write a new definition if needed
  \item Say if it has positive or negative connotation (for some)
  \end{itemize}
  this shows how little you need to know to understand and enjoy
\item Rewrite it using only the most common 1,000 words of English
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Like XKCD's \href{https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/}{Simple Writer}
    (used in \textit{Thing Explainer})
  \item We only did this for \sh{REDH}
  \end{itemize}
  this also shows some interesting misunderstandings
\item Look for Idioms and Metaphors
\end{itemize}


%\section{Word Meaning Revisited}

% \myslide{Defining Meaning}

% \begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1.5ex}
% \item When we use a word, we don't have to know everything about the
%   referent
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item A \eng{dog-cart} is a kind of \con{cart}
%   \item[\ent] you can ride it
%   \item[\ent] it has wheels
%   \item[\ent] it has something to do with a dog
%   \end{itemize}
% \item We infer that it has many of the same properties as its
%   hypernym, even though this is not always true
%  \begin{itemize}
%   \item A \eng{hover-car} is a kind of \con{car}
%   \item[\ent] you can ride it
%   \item[$\not\Rightarrow$] it has wheels
%   \end{itemize}
% \item Many of the properties may be irrelevant to the story at hand,
%   and irrelevant to the syntax of the language
% \end{itemize}

% \myslide{How do we learn?}
% \vspace*{-1ex}
% \begin{quote}
%   \textit{You shall know a word by the company it keeps} \hfill
% \citep[p11]{Firth:1957}
% \end{quote}
% \vspace*{-1ex}
% \begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-2ex}
% \item You see a new word \emp{in context}
% \\ \eng{buttoning up his \ul{pea-jacket}, }
% \begin{itemize}
% \item[\ent] it is a kind of jacket \hfill(\eng{green jacket}?)
% \item[\ent] with buttons
% \item [?] it is thick material (they are going to a stake out)
% \item[?] it has something to do with peas \\ not true (from the West
%   Frisian word \eng{pijjakker}, in which \eng{pij} referred to the
%   type of cloth used, a coarse kind of \ul{twilled} blue cloth)
% \end{itemize}
% \item And you deduce information from the context
% \item We are getting better at doing this with computers
% \begin{itemize}
% \item but people use more than words: eyes, noses and other senses
% \end{itemize}

% \end{itemize}

% \myslide{How else do we learn?}

% \begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1.5ex}
% \item From word internal cues
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item \eng[far vision]{Television} 
%   \item \eng[internet phone]{iphone} 
%     (also individual, instruct, inform, inspire)
%   \item 鯖 \jpn[mackerel]{saba} = 魚 fish; 青 blue
%   \end{itemize}
% \item From the sound
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item \eng{bouba/kiki}  $\star$ or $\clubsuit$
%   \item \eng{banged, beaten, battered, bruised, blistered, bashed}
%   \item mouth shape for \eng{teeny weeny} vs \eng{large}
%   \end{itemize}
% \item From  images:
%   \begin{tabular}[t]{c}
% \includegraphics[width=4em]{pics/magnifying-glass} \\    
%  \eng{Magnifying Glass} 
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{itemize}


% \myslide{Words are related in many other ways}


% \begin{itemize}
% \item Domains: \eng{ball, racket, net, love, ace}
% \item Origin: \eng{chew, eat, drink} vs \eng{masticate, consume, imbibe}
% \item[?] come up with some words with different origins\task 
%   \\ English or another language!
% \item Dialect: \eng{ripper, bonza, sickie, no worries}
% \item Part-of-speech: \eng{die, live} vs \eng{death, life}
% \item When you learned them!
% \item and many more
% \end{itemize}

% All of these relations affect how you use and understand language.

% \myslide{Idioms}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Some expressions clearly involve more than one orthographic word
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item compound noun
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item \eng{\ul{grass snake}}; \eng{\ul{grass} and \ul{tree} \uuline{snakes}}
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item verb-particle

%     \item \eng{\ul{going great guns}, \ul{give the Devil his due}}
%     \item \eng{\ul{jog someone's memory}}
%     \item \eng{\ul{blow one's top}}, \eng{\ul{cast one's eyes}}

% % kindle excitement, fresh air, \ldots}
%   \end{itemize}
% \item Knowing the individual words is not enough to know the meaning (or usage)
  
% \end{itemize}

% % \myslide{Multiword Expressions (MWE)}

% % There are many different kinds of irregularity.

% % \begin{tabular}{lccccc}
% %   MWE & \multicolumn{5}{c}{Weirdness} \\

% \myslide{How common are MWEs?}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item They are very common in the lexicon
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item In wordnet,  41\% of the entries are multiword %(mainly compound nouns)
%   \end{itemize}

\section{Sense Distributions in NTU-MC}

\myslide{Cross-lingual comparison}

We consider a single Sherlock Holmes story \textit{The Adventure of
  the Speckled Band}\citep{Doyle:1892} in the original English and
translations in Mandarin Chinese, Indonesian and Japanese \citep[NTU Multilingual Corpus:][]{Tan:Bond:2012}.  The senses
are tagged with the Princeton Wordnet of English
\citep{_Fellbaum:1998}, the Chinese Open Wordnet
\citep[see][]{Wang:Bond:2013}, the Wordnet Bahasa
\citep{Bond:Lim:Tan:Riza:2014} and the Japanese
wordnet\citep{Isahara:Bond:Uchimoto:Utiyama:Kanzaki:2008} enhanced
with pronouns, exclamatives and classifiers
\citep[COW: ][]{Seah:Bond:2014,daCosta:Bond:2016}.  On the basis of wordnet
alignment within the Open Multilingual WordNet
\citep{Bond:Foster:2013}, we are able to compare the distribution of
senses across languages.

\myslide{One Sense Per Discourse}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Gale hypothesized that a
    single word would tend to have a single sense within a given
    discourse. 
  \item   This was definitely not the case here, in any language.
  \item We get from 9--11 different meanings, with (light) verbs and adverbs
    being most ambiguous --- more true for nouns
    \begin{itemize}
    \item en: \lex{see, be, so, make, have}
    \item ja: \lex{ある, 分かる, 持つ, 考える, もの}
    \item zh: \lex{好, 可能, 是, 发现, 有}

\myslide{Variation for a concept}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Variation (how many ways can you express the same concept) was

   \lex{可是} (26), \lex{尽管} (1), \lex{不过} (4)
   \begin{itemize}
   \item this is probably an artifact of the fact we have checked
     adverbs less, \ldots

\section{Automatic \\ Word Sense Disambiguation}

\myslide{Word Sense Disambiguation Overview}

\begin{itemize}
\item Many words have several meanings (homonymy/polysemy)
\item Determine which sense of a word is used in a specific text
\item Often, the different senses of a word are closely related
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lex{title$_1$} -  right of legal ownership
  \item \lex{title$_2$} -  document that is evidence of the legal ownership,
  \end{itemize}
\item sometimes, several senses can be activated in a single context
  \begin{itemize}
\item \ldots \eng{This could bring competition to the trade}
  \item  \lex{competition$_1$} - the act of competing
  \item  \lex{competition$_2$} - the people who are competing
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{What are Word Senses?}

\begin{itemize}
\item The meaning of a word in a given context
\item Word sense representations
  \begin{itemize}
\item With respect to a dictionary (WordNet)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  chair = a seat for one person, with a support for the back; 
    \\ "he put his coat over the back of the chair and sat down"
  \item chair = the officer who presides at the meetings of an organization; 
    \\"address your remarks to the chairperson"
  \end{itemize}
\item   With respect to the translation in a second language
  \begin{itemize}
  \item   chair = chaise
  \item      chair = directeur
  \end{itemize}
\item With respect to the context where it occurs (discrimination)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Sit on a chair''  ``Take a seat on this chair''
    \item ``The chair of the Math Department'' ``The chair of the meeting''
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge-Based Disambiguation
  \begin{itemize}

\item Supervised Disambiguation
  \begin{itemize}
  \item based on a labeled training set
  \item basically a sequence labeling task with a lot of labels
  \end{itemize}
\item Unsupervised Disambiguation
  \begin{itemize}
  \item based on unlabeled corpora
  \item learn sense distinctions then disambiguate!

\begin{itemize}
\item Attempt to disambiguate all open-class words in a text

\item Knowledge-based approaches
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use information from dictionaries
  \item Definitions / Examples for each meaning
  \item Find similarity between definitions and current context
  \end{itemize}
\item   Position in a semantic network
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Find that \eng{table} is closer to \eng{chair} ``furniture''
    than to \eng{chair} ``person''
  \end{itemize}
\item Use discourse properties
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A word exhibits the same sense in a discourse / in a collocation

\myslide{WSD with Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRD)}

\begin{itemize}
\item MRD-based WSD shown to provide very high unsupervised baseline

\item Suitable for all words WSD tasks (no data bottleneck)
\item MRDs have (relatively) high availability compared to
  sensebanked data
\item MRD-based WSD is easily adaptable to new MRDs, languages

  \end{itemize}
\item A thesaurus adds:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item An explicit synonymy relation between word meanings
  \end{itemize}

\item A semantic network/ontology adds:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Hypernymy/hyponymy (IS-A), meronymy/holonymy (PART-OF), antonymy, entailnment, etc.

\myslide{Discourse based Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item One sense per discourse
\item One sense per collocation
\end{itemize}

\myslide{One Sense per Discourse}
\begin{itemize}
\item A word tends to preserve its meaning across all its occurrences in a discourse (Gale, Church, Yarowksy 1992)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 8 words with two-way ambiguity, e.g. \eng{plant, crane, \ldots}
  \item 98\% of the two-word occurrences in the same discourse carry the same meaning
  \end{itemize}
\item The grain of salt: Performance depends on granularity
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Performance of ``one sense per discourse'' over all words is $\approx 70\%$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{One Sense per Collocation}
\begin{itemize}
\item A word tends to preserve its meaning when used in the same collocation (Yarowsky 1993)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Strong for adjacent collocations
  \item Weaker as the distance between words increases
  \end{itemize}

\item For example, in a typical corpus
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng{industrial plant} is always the plant/factory
  \item \eng{plant life} is always the plant/flora
  \end{itemize}
\item 97\% precision on words with two-way ambiguity
\item $\approx 70\%$ on all words
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Typical Performance}

\begin{itemize}
\item First Sense: 63\% \com{baseline}
\item Extended Lesk:  68\%
\item Supervised: 70-72\% \com{most words}
\item Much harder task than POS tagging
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Improve by reducing granularity (cluster senses)
  \item Improve by increasing training data
  \item Improve with more features (adding in syntax)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{How can we annotate data?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Get people to do it
  \begin{itemize}
  \item per word (e.g. look at all \eng{plant}) annotation much faster then per sentence
  \end{itemize}
\item Look at translations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item disambiguate with other languages
  \end{itemize}
\item Learn collocations from unambiguous synonyms 
\\ (\eng{pinecone, cone, strobilus, strobile})
\item Bootstrap
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Annotate some, assume one sense/discourse

This is part of our knowledge of language, so it should be in the lexicon.

\myslide{Some more examples}

\begin{tabular}{lll}

interested & questioning & nosy \\
employ & use & exploit \\
thrifty & saving & stingy \\

Can you identify the negative words?\task
\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-2ex}
\item \eng{East End is a gritty neighborhood, but the rents are low.}
\item \eng{On my train to Sussex, I sat next to a real stunner.}
\item \eng{Every morning my neighbor takes his mutt to the moor. It always barks loudly when leaving the building.}
\item \eng{You need to be pushy when you are looking for a job.}
\item \eng{Watson is bullheaded sometimes, but he always gets the job done.}
  \end{itemize}
  
\myslide{How can we represent this?}

\begin{itemize}
\item One approach is a simple valence score ($-100$ -- $+100$)
\end{itemize}

    \begin{tabular}{rllll}
      \textbf{Score} & \textbf{Example} & \textbf{Example} & \textbf{Example} & 
      \textbf{Corpus Examples} \\
      \hline
      95 & fantastic & very good     &            & {perfect}, splendidly  \\ 
      64 & good      & good          &            & {soothing}, pleasure  \\
      34 & ok        & sort of good  & not bad    & {easy}, interesting  \\ 
      0  & beige     & neutral       &            & {puff}  \\  
      -34 & poorly    & a bit bad     &            & rumour, cripple  \\
      -64 & bad       & bad           & not good   & {hideous}, death  \\
      -95 & awful     & very bad      &            & {deadly}, horror-stricken     
\end{tabular}

\begin{itemize}
\item You can also have two scores (positive and negative) or even
  three (positive, negative and neutral)
\item People also consider the associated emotion: \citep{Plutchik:1980}
\\  joy vs sadness; anger vs fear; trust vs disgust;  surprise vs anticipation. 
\end{itemize}
    

\myslide{High and Low Examples}

We will just look at a simple valence.  Here are some results from
DANC and SPEC, annotated in three languages.


  \begin{small}
    \begin{tabular}{lrrllrlrlr}
      Concept & freq & score & English & score & Chinese & score & Japanese & Score \\
      \hline
      % 01036996-n
      \ili{i40833}  &   24 &  50 & marriage & 39 & 婚事 & 34 & 結婚	& 58\\
      &      &  & wedding  & 34 \\   
      % 02021905-a
      \ili{i11080}  & 5& 40  &  rich & 33 & 有钱 & 34 &  裕福 & 66  \\
      % 06878071-n
      \ili{i72643} & 4 & 33 &  smile &   32 & 微笑	& 34 & 笑み & 34 \\
      % 00358431-v
      \ili{i23529}  & 40 & $-$68  & die & $-$80 &  去世 & $-$60 &亡くなる & $-63$ \\
      &        &  &  &       & 死亡  & $-$64 & 死ぬ & $-$62\\
      % 00220522-n
      \ili{i36562}  & 5  & $-$83 & murder &$-$95  & 谋杀 & $-$95	 & 殺し & 	$-$64 \\
      &     &      && & & & 殺害 & $-$63 \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{small}

Frequency is across all languages, score is average for lemma.

\begin{itemize}
\item Senses in the same concept tend to have similar scores
  \begin{itemize}
  \item this is true within and across languages
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\myslide{Cross-Language Correlation}

  We looked at the agreement between annotators for the same concept
  across all three languages. The annotators were shown the scores
  organized per word and per sense: where there was a large divergence
  (greater than one standard deviation), they went back and checked
  their annotation.  After this harmonization we calculated Pearson's
  $\rho$ \citep{Pearson:1895}.

 \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{lrr}
    \textbf{Pair} & $\rho$ & \textbf{\# samples} \\
    \hline
    Chinese-English  & .73   &  6,843   \\     
    Chinese-Japanese & .77   &  4,099     \\     
    English-Japanese & .76   &  4,163      
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

% We found the English annotator to be consistently more extreme than
% the Chinese and Japanese annotators.
