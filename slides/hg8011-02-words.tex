\myslide{Why Sherlock Holmes?}
\MyLogo{I want to make studying semantics more accessible}
\begin{itemize}
\item Enjoyable, accessible, popular  stories (and adaptions)
\item Sherlock Holmes 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A London-based consulting detective
    
  \item who solves many cases with a quirky personality
  \item and immense powers of observation and raticionation
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \raisebox{-15ex}[0ex][0ex]{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{pics/Sherlock_Holmes_Portrait_Paget}}
  \item and his faithful friend: John Watson
\end{itemize}
\item A fictional character, invented by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
  \begin{itemize}
  \item in 60 stories,  published between 1887 and 1927
  \item Mainly narrated by Watson
  \end{itemize}
\item Some stories are annotated with word senses as part of our
  research in semantics
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The NTU --- Multilingual Corpus (NTU-MC)
  \item We will use and experience this during the course --- learn by doing
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Revision: \\ Introduction to Semantics}

\myslide{What is Semantics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Very broadly, semantics is the study of meaning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Word meaning
  \item Sentence meaning
  \end{itemize}
\item Layers of Linguistic Analysis
  \begin{enumerate}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.75ex}
  \item Phonetics \& Phonology
  \item Morphology
  \item Syntax
  \item \emp{Semantics}
  \item Pragmatics
  \item Stylistics
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}



\myslide{Meaning in the larger context}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Semiotics} is the study of interpreting symbols, or \txx{signification}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We refer to the \txx{signified}
  \item Using a \txx{signifier}\hfill Saussure
  \end{itemize}
% \item Problems with defining meaning
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item The \txx{grounding} problem and \txx{circularity}
%   \item The boundaries of meaning: \txx{linguistic} vs \txx{encyclopedic knowledge}
%   \item Individual variation in meaning: \txx{idiolects}
%   \item Words can be combined to form an infinite number of expressions
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item This building up of meaning is referred to as \txx{composition}
%     \item If the meaning of the whole can be built up from the parts then it is \txx{compositional}
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \myslide{Metalanguages and Notational Conventions}
\item We use language to talk about language, which can get messy.  So we
try to use certain words with very specific technical senses.

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{technical term} $\leftarrow$ remember me!
\item \eng[gloss]{word} or \eng{utterance}: example of a word/expression being used
\item \lex{lexeme}: the abstraction of word in the lexicon
\item \iz{predicate}: the abstraction of the meaning in the lexicon/formal semantic system
\item \con{concept}: the meaning in a person's mind
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Utterances, Sentences and Propositions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{utterance}: an actual instance of saying (or writing  or \ldots) something
\item \txx{sentence}: an abstraction, the type of what was said
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Caesar invades Gaul}
  \end{exe}
\item \txx{proposition}: a further abstraction, normally ignoring some non-literal meaning
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \iz{invade(Caesar, Gaul)}
  \end{exe}
\item \txx{interpretation}: our mental representation (linked to our
  existing knowledge)
\end{itemize}

\item[10085] \eng{He had no friends at all save the wandering
  gipsies , and he would give these vagabonds \ul{leave} to encamp upon
  the few acres of bramble- covered land which represent the family
  estate , and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents
  , wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end .}
% leave (permission to do something;) 
\item[10107] \eng{She
  \ul{left} her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for
  some time , chatting about her approaching wedding .}

  . "}
% leave (put into the care or protection of someone;) 
\item[10449] \eng{And now , Miss Stoner , we must \ul{leave} you for if
  Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain .

\myslide{How can we represent the differences?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Definitions
\item Translations/paraphrases
\item Semantic Relations
\item Components
\item Vector Spaces
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Semantic Representations of Words}

\begin{itemize}
\item Divide meaning into
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{reference}: the relation to the world/mental space
  \item \txx{sense}: the rest of the meaning
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \txx{denotation} the part that distinguishes the meaning
      from other meanings
    \item \txx{connotation}  cultural or emotional associations 
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item Introduce \con{concepts} \hfill (meaning as font-change)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item How can we represent concepts?
  \item How do we learn them?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Typically children start off by \txx{underextending} or \txx{overextending} concepts
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item Example: \eng{That dog}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item reference --- the animal over there
  \item sense --- canine quadruped domesticated by man
  \item connotation --- faithful, friendly (or dirty
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\myslide{Definitional Semantics}

%\MyLogo{\citet{Jackson:2002,Wilks+:1996}}

\begin{itemize}
\item Standard lexicographic approach to lexical semantics:
  \begin{quote}
    \textbf{semantics} = \eng{the \textcolor{blue}{study} of \textcolor{brown}{language meaning}}\\
    \textbf{tailor} = \eng{a \textcolor{blue}{person} whose \textcolor{brown}{occupation is making and altering garments}}
  \end{quote}
\item Definitions are conventionally made up of;
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{blue}{genus}: what class the lexical item belongs to
  \item \textcolor{brown}{differentiae}: what attributes distinguish it from
  other members of that class
\end{itemize}
% \item ``Decoding'' vs.\ ``encoding'' dictionaries
\item Often hard to understand if you don't already know the meaning!
\myslide{Definitional Semantics: pros and cons}
\item Pros:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item familiarity (we are taught to use dictionaries)
  \end{itemize}
\item Cons:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item subjectivity in sense granularity (splitters vs.\ lumpers) and
    definition specificity
  \item circularity in definitions
  \item consistency, reproducibility, \ldots
  \item often focus on diachronic (historical) rather than synchronic (current) semantics 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Saying the same thing in different words
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Same language = \txx{paraphrase}
  \item Different language = \txx{translation}
  \end{itemize}
\item We showed some paraphrases in the entries given above
\item If you speak another language, then you can use that to
  disambiguate may things.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lex{leave, entrust} = 預ける \jpn{azukeru}
  \item \lex{get out, go out, leave, exit} = 去る \jpn{saru}
  \item \lex{leave, will, bequeath} = 遺す \jpn{nokosu}

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Lexical Semantics}

\MyLogo{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lexical semantics is concerned with the identification and
  representation of the semantics of lexical items
\item If we are to identify the semantics of lexical items, we have to
  be prepared for the eventuality of a given word having 
  multiple interpretations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{Polysemy}: having multiple meanings
  \item \txx{Monosemy}: having only one meaning
  \end{itemize}
\item \txx{Homonyms} are words with two unrelated meanings:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{homographs}: same spelling 
    \\ \eng{bow} vs \eng{bow}; \eng{keep} vs \eng{keep}
  \item \txx{homophones}: same pronunciation
     \\ \eng{right} vs \eng{write}; \eng{keep} vs \eng{keep}
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}






% \myslide{Polysemy}

% \MyLogo{\citet{Cruse:1986,Hirst:1987,_Ravin:Leacock:2000,Pustejovsky:1995}}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Polysemy} = the condition of a single lexical item having
%   multiple meanings
% \item Polysemy vs.\ homonymy (cf.\ \eng{bank} vs.\ \eng{bass})
% \item Polysemy vs.\ indeterminacy (cf.\ \eng{father} vs.\ \eng{uncle})
% \item Regular/logical vs.\ irregular polysemy (cf.\ \eng{ash})
% \item Regular vs.\ complementary polysemy (cf.\ \eng{door} vs.\ \eng{farm})
% \end{itemize}




\myslide{Distinguishing Polysemes}

The polysemy of a word can be tested by a variety of means, including:
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Antagonism}: can the word be used in a sentence with
  multiple \underline{competing} interpretations that are incompatible? \\[1ex]
  \eng{Kim can't  bear children}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Cannot have children
  \item Doesn't like children
  \end{itemize}
\item \txx{Zeugma}: can the word be used in a context where multiple
  \underline{competing} interpretations are simultaneously evoked? \\[1ex]
  \eng{Kim and her visa expired}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item died
    \item ran out
    \end{itemize}
 \eng{Hitmen were quite expensive, so she decided to take out a loan and her husband.} \task
  \item  \txx{Paraphrase/Translation}: Is there more than one (clearly different) way to paraphrase/translate the word.
  \end{itemize}

\myslide{Necessary and Sufficient Conditions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can we define words in terms of \txx{conditions}?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lex{zebra}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item quadruped
    \item animal \com{redundant}
    \item black and white striped
    \item herbivore
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item These are \txx{intrinsic}, \txx{generic} properties
\item Can we use words even if we don't know their properties?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lex{Kway Teow}
  \end{itemize}
\item We seem to be ok with fairly vague definitions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What is a \lex{dog-cart}? \task
  \item What is a \lex{swamp adder}? \task
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\myslide{Words/Concepts are related in many ways}

We can also look at words (or more properly senses) in terms of their
relations to other words.

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Hyponymy/Hypernemy}
\item \txx{Synonymy}
\item \txx{Antonymy} (Opposites)
\item \txx{Meronymy}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \txx{Member-Collection}
    \item \txx{Portion-Mass}
    \item \txx{Element-Substance}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \txx{Domain} (lexical field)
\end{itemize}





\myslide{Hypernymy and Hyponymy}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Hyponymy}: X is a hyponym of Y iff
  $f(X)$ entails $f(Y)$ but $f(Y)$ does not entail $f(X)$ (for all or most $f$):
  \begin{quote}
    \eng{Kim has a pet \underline{dog} $\vDash$  Kim has a pet \underline{animal}}\\
    \eng{Kim has a pet \underline{animal} $\not\vDash$  Kim has a pet \underline{dog}}
  \end{quote}
  N.B.\ complications with universal quantifiers and negation:
  \begin{quote}
    \eng{Kim likes all \underline{animals} $\vDash$  Kim likes all \underline{dogs}}\\
    \eng{Kim likes all \underline{dogs} $\not\vDash$  Kim likes all \underline{animals}}
  \end{quote}
\item \txx{Hypernymy}: Y is a hypernym of X iff X is a hyponym of Y
\item Can a word have multiple hypernyms?
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \lex{tank$_1$} $\subset$ \lex{military\_vehicle$_1$}; $\subset$ \lex{tracked\_vehicle}$_1$; 
    $\subset$ \lex{armored\_vehicle$_1$}; ? $\subset$ \lex{weapon$_1$}
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{What is \txx{entailment}}
\begin{quote}
  \txx{Entailment} ($\vDash$): A sentence $p$ entails a sentence $q$ when the
  truth of the first ($p$) guarantees the truth of the second ($q$),
  and the falsity of the second ($q$) guarantees the falsity of the
  first ($p$).
\end{quote}

\myslide{Properties of hypernymy/hyponymy}
  \begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
  \item Asymmetric; applies at the sense level
  \item applies only to lexical items of the same word class
  \item Transitive: \lex{dog$_1$} $\subset$ \lex{mammal$_1$} $\subset$ \lex{animal$_1$}
  \item Not all nodes are lexicalized; can be multiple \\[2ex]
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
      neutral (Hyper) & male & female & child \\ \hline
%      pig & hog & sow & piglet\\
      \lex{sheep} & \lex{ram} & \lex{ewe} & \lex{lamb}\\
      \lex{cow} & \lex{bull} & \lex{\ul{cow}} & \lex{calf} \\
      \lex{goose} & \lex{gander} & \lex{\ul{goose}} & \lex{gosling}  \\
      \lex{horse} & \lex{stallion} & \lex{mare} & \lex{foal:colt/filly} \\
      \lex{dog} &  \lex{\ul{dog}} &  \lex{bitch} &\lex{puppy} \\
      \lex{snake} & \lex{\ul{snake}}& \lex{\ul{snake}}& \lex{\ul{snake}}\\
    \end{tabular}
  \item Can you do this for \lex{pig}, \lex{cat} or \lex{chicken}?\task
  \item Can you give an example of this in another language?\task
  \end{itemize}



\myslide{Synonymy}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Propositional synonymy}: X is a propositional synonym of Y if
  \begin{itemize}
  \item   (i) X and Y are syntactically identical,
  \item (ii) substitution of Y  for X in a declarative sentence doesn't change its truth conditions
  \end{itemize}
  e.g., \lex{violin} and \lex{fiddle}
\item Why propositional synonymy is over-restrictive:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item syntactic identity (cf.\ \lex{eat} and \lex{devour})
  \item collocations (cf.\ \lex{cemetery} and \lex{graveyard})
  \item gradability (cf.\ \lex{sofa}/\lex{settee} vs.\ \lex{boundary/frontier})
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Near Synonymy}
\begin{itemize}
\item Synonyms are substitutable in \textbf{some/most} rather than \textbf{all} contexts
\item Synonymy via semantics: synonyms share ``common traits'' or
  attributional overlap, walking the fine line between ``necessary
  resemblances'' and ``permissible differences'':
  \begin{quote}
      \lex{grain} vs. \lex{granule};  \lex{green} vs.\ \lex{purple}; \lex{alsation} vs. \lex{spaniel}
  \end{quote}
\item Permissible differentiation via \textbf{clarification}:
  \begin{quote}
    \eng{Here is a \underline{grain}, or \underline{granule}, of the substance.}\\
    \eng{* The cover is \underline{green}, \{or, that is to say\} \underline{purple}.}
  \end{quote}
  and \textbf{contrast}:
  \begin{quote}
    \eng{Here is a \underline{grain} or, more exactly, \underline{granule}}\\
    \eng{* He likes alsations, or more exactly, \underline{spaniels}}
  \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Properties of synonymy}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Symmetric
  \item traditionally applies only to lexical items of the same word class
    \\ but pairs like \lex{can} vs \lex{be able to} suggest otherwise
  \item applied at the sense level?
  \item $\approx$ converse of polysemy
  \end{itemize}



\myslide{Antonymy (opposites)}

%\MyLogo{\citet{Cruse:1986,Miller:1990}}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Simple antonyms}: the negative of one implies the positive of the other.
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{dead/alive}
    \ex \eng{pass/fail}
  \end{exe}
\item \txx{Gradable Antonyms}: points  along a scale

    \ex \eng{boiling/hot/warm/tepid/cool/cold/freezing}
    \ex \eng{like this class/fascinating/interesting/dull/boring}
  \end{exe}

    \ex \eng{above/below; right/left}
    \ex \eng{employer/employee}
  \end{exe}
  (Slightly non-standard usage)
\item \txx{Taxonomic Sisters}: children of the same (grand)parent
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Monday/Tuesday/\ldots{}/Sunday}
    \\ \textnormal{in WordNet:} \lex{day of the week} $\supset$ \lex{weekday}, \lex{weekend}
    \ex \eng{LMS/English/Chinese/\ldots}
    \\  \textnormal{Context dependent}
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Meronymy}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Meronomy} refers to the part-whole relation
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{meronym} is the part
  \item \txx{holonym} is the whole
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{tree}
    \br{\lex{car}}{
      \br{\lex{wheel}}{\lf{\lex{tire}} \lf{\lex{rim}}}
      \br{\lex{engine}}{\br{\lex{piston}}{} \br{\lex{valve}}{}}
      \br{\lex{door}}{}
      \br{\lex{steering wheel}}{}}
  \end{tree}
\item It is not always transitive
  \begin{tree}
      \br{\lex{shirt}}{
        \br{\lex{button}}{\br{\lex{button hole}}{}}}
   \end{tree} \\
  But we don't normally say that a \lex{button hole} is part of a \lex{shirt}.
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Member-Collection}

\begin{itemize}

\item Made up of four separate semantic nets, for each of nouns, verbs,
  adjectives and adverbs
\item WordNets exist for many languages, at LMS we work on:

1. enrichment -- (act of making fuller or more 
   meaningful or rewarding)
2. enrichment -- (a gift that significantly increases 
   the recipient's wealth)

\item Lexical relations at either the synset level or sense (=
  combination of lexical item and synset) level 
\item Strongly lexicalist (orginally):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item synsets only where words exist
  \item but many multiword expressions ($\approx 50\%$)
%  \item (near) absence of frame semantics
  \end{itemize}

\section{Where is the meaning?}





\myslide{Referential or Representational?}

One view of meaning is to define it in terms of how it constrains reality.

\begin{itemize}
\item Picture the worlds in which these sentences are true:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{I patted the dog.}
    \ex \eng{I did not pat the dog.}
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}

Assuming that they were uttered at the same time, they are
incompatible because they cannot refer to the same
situation: the \txx{referential} view. 

But we can represent the same reality in different ways:

\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{Ich habe Hunger} ``I have hunger''
  \ex \eng{I am hungry}
\end{exe}

\txx{Representational} theories are interested in how we represent reality,
and how our representations are influenced by conceptual structures
conventionalized in language.

     \put(3,30){\makebox(0,0){Say}}

   \end{picture}
 \end{center}

 The \txx{referential view} is focused on direct relationships between
 expressions (words, sentences) and things in the world (realist
 view).

\vspace{-4em} The \txx{representational view} is focused on how relationships between
 expressions (words, sentences) and things in the world are mediated by
 the mind (cognitive linguistics).  

This gives a more complex, but richer model.


\myslide{Referring vs Non-Referring}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Referring expressions} are expressions that identify
  entities in the world (typically \txx{nominals})
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{cat}, \jpn[that yellow bag]{ano kiiro kaban}
    \ex \eng{London Bridge}, \eng{Xiao Ming}
  \end{exe}
\item \txx{Non-referring expressions} don't have referential properties
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{maybe, if, is, but}
  \end{exe}
\item Not all nominals refer
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{That is \ul{an ugly dog}}
    \ex \eng{If only I had \ul{a dog}}
  \end{exe}
\item And, of course, all this is made more confusing if we model the
  fictional world and our interpretation of it as separate from the
  characters' interpretations, \ldots
\end{itemize}


\section{Deixis}


\myslide{What is Deixis}
\begin{itemize}
\item any linguistic element whose interpretation
  necessarily makes reference to properties of the
  extra-linguistic context in which it occurs is \txx{deictic}
  \begin{description}
  \item[\txx{Person}] relative to the speaker and addressee; \eng{you, me, them}
  \item[\txx{Spatial Location}] demonstratives; \eng{this, that, over there, here}
  \item[\txx{Temporal Location}] tense; \eng{yesterday, today, tomorrow}
  \item[\txx{Social Status}] relative to the social position: \eng{professor, you, uncle, boy}
  \end{description}
\item \txx{Discourse deixis}: referring to a linguistic expression or chunk of discourse
\end{itemize}

More than 90\% of the declarative sentences people utter are indexical
in that they involve implicit references to the speaker, addressee,
time and/or place of utterance in expressions like first and second
person pronouns, demonstratives, tenses, and adverbs like \lex{here}, \lex{now},
\lex{yesterday} \citep[p366]{Bar-Hillel:1954}.

\myslide{Spatial Deixis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two way systems (English, \ldots)

    \txx{distal} &\lex{that} & \lex{there} & far to the speaker 
  \end{tabular}
\item Three (four) way systems (Japanese, \ldots)
    \\[2ex] \begin{tabular}{lllll}
                    & Gloss & \con{thing}   & \con{place}  \\

  \end{tabular}
  \item Can you do English \con{time}?  \task %\marginpar{\fbox{\LARGE ?}}
  \item Can you do this in another language?\task %\marginpar{\fbox{\LARGE ?}}

 % Can decompose: \lex{here} ``this place'', \lex{there} ``that place'', \lex{where} ``what place''
 % \lex{now} ``this time'',  \lex{then} ``that time'', \lex{when} ``what time''

\myslide{More Spatial Deixis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Often lexicalized:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lex{go, come, foreign, home, local, indigenous, national language}
  \end{itemize}
\item Can lead to \txx{discourse}/\txx{textual deixis}
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{\ul{Here} we begin explaining textual deixis}
  \end{exe}
\item Often also used for time
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{\ul{This year} we are trying a new kind of assignment}
  \end{exe}
\newpage
\item Spatial expressions extend to possession in many languages
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \gll \jpn{NICT-ga} \jpn{Kyoto-ni} \jpn{aru} \\
    NICT-\textsc{nom} Kyoto-\textsc{loc} be \\
    \trans NICT is in Kyoto
    \ex \gll \jpn{watashi-ni} \jpn{musuko-ga}  \jpn{aru} \\
     I-\textsc{loc}  son-\textsc{nom} be \\
    \trans I have a son (lit. a son is in me)
   \end{exe}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Person Deixis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Minimally a three way division
\\[2ex]  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    First Person & Speaker & \lex{I} \\
    Second Person & Addressee & \lex{you} \\
    Third Person & Other & \lex{he/she/it} \\
  \end{tabular}
\item Often combined with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{gender}: \lex{he/she/it }
  \item \txx{number}: \lex{I/we}, 
    \lex{'anta} ``you:m'', \lex{'antumaa} ``you:dual'',  \lex{'antum} ``you:m:pl''
    \\ (Arabic)
  \item \txx{inclusion}: \lex{n\'uy} ``we including you'',  \lex{n\'{\i}i} ``we excluding you'' (Zayse)
  \item \txx{honorification}: \lex{kimi} ``you:inferior'', \lex{anata} ``you:equal'',
    \\ don't use pronouns for superiors: \lex{sensei} ``teacher'', \ldots (Japanese)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Social Deixis}

In European languages, a two-way choice in 2nd person pronominal
reference is known as the T/V distinction, based on the French forms
for ``you''.

\begin{itemize}
\item T/V distinctions in European languages
\\[2ex]  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    & Familiar 2sg & Polite 2sg \\ \hline
    French & \lex{tu} & \lex{vous} \\
    German & \lex{du} & \lex{Sie} \\
    Spanish & \lex{t\'u} & \lex{usted}
  \end{tabular}

\item Shift from asymmetric use showing \txx{power} (superior uses \lex{du}; inferior uses \lex{vous}) to symmetric use showing \txx{solidarity} (strangers use  \lex{vous}; intimates use \lex{du}): typically the socially superior person must invite the socially
  inferior person to use the familiar form

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The language we think in makes some concepts easy to express,
%   and some concepts hard
% \item The idea behind \txx{linguistic relativity} is that this will
%   effect how you think
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Korean lexicalizes politeness and has rigid social hierarchies
%   \item English and Chinese speakers differ as to whether they
%     concepualize things as substances or individuals
%   \item Gendered language speakers have different connotations: \lex{key}
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item (German: masculine) `hard, heavy, jagged, metal, and useful'
%     \item (Spanish: feminine)  `golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny'
%     \end{itemize}
%   \item It is easier to differentiate colors that you have names for
%   \end{itemize}
% \item Most confirmed differences are very, very subtle

% \myslide{The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis}

% \begin{description}
% \item[strong]  language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories
% \item[weak]  linguistic categories and usage influence thought and certain kinds of non-linguistic behaviour
% \end{description}

% The terms "Strong/Weak Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis" is widely used even though Edward
% Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co-authored anything and never
% stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis let alone with two versions.

% \myslide{What Whorf actually said}
% \begin{quotation}
%   We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The
%   categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we
%   do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on
%   the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of
%   impressions which has to be organized by our minds—and this means
%   largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. We cut nature up,
%   organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do,
%   largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in
%   this way—an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and
%   is codified in the patterns of our language [\ldots] all observers
%   are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the
%   universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in
%   some way be calibrated.

\begin{itemize}
\item How many words are there in the following?
  \begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{He who laughs last laughs longest.}
  \ex \eng{If he is right and I am wrong, are we both in trouble?}
  \ex \eng{I'm gonna go to the  station-master.}
  \ex \eng{Sorry to knock you up, Mr Holmes.}

\end{exe}  

\item \txx{Tokens}: Individual instances of a class
\item \txx{Types}: The class as a whole
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
\item  Why do we need a definition for \lex{word}?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Psychological reality:  People can divide language into words
  \item Phonological contours:  People pronounce words as unit
  \item Orthographic practice: Many languages put spaces between words
(although this practice only began around 600 CE for Latin, and did
not spread to all European languages 'til as late as the 1600s)
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Some put them between phrases (Korean)
 \item Some words include spaces \eng{New York}, \eng{ad hoc}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Bloomfield's grammatical definition}

\begin{quote}
A word, then, is a free form, which does not consist
entirely of (two or more) lesser free forms; in brief, a
word is a \textit{minimum free form}.
\begin{flushright}
  (Bloomfield 1984: p178) 
\end{flushright}
 \end{quote}

In practice, the definition is somewhat task specific: it may make more sense to talk of \txx{orthographic words}, \txx{semantic words} or \txx{predicates}, \ldots .
