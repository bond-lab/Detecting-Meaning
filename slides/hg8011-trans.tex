\myslide{Holmes and translation}

\begin{itemize}
\item What did Sir Arthur Conan Doyle think about translation ?
\item  How can/do we know?

  \\ 
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Mr Melas}
\begin{itemize}
\item This story introduces Mycroft, Sherlock's brother
\item He says of the interpreter
  \begin{quote}
    \textit{Mr. Melas is a Greek by extraction,
as I understand, and he is a remarkable
linguist. He earns his living partly as interpreter
in the law courts and partly by acting as guide
to any wealthy Orientals who may visit the
Northumberland Avenue hotels. I think I will
leave him to tell his very remarkable
experience in his own fashion. } \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\item Highlights the importance of translating
\item Clearly Conan Doyle thought highly of translators!

\myslide{Translating into Chinese}

\begin{itemize}
\item This story was translated into Chinese
\item  希腊舌人 \cmn{xīlà shérén} “Greek tongue-man”
\item  What does it mean?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Early Western Han Period, after 206 BCE
  \item shérén (舌人, tongue-men) was the common name for the
    government officials in charge of communicating with the
    neighbouring tribes of the Zhou Dynasty.  Ref: “Martha
    P.Y. Cheung, “Early Discourse on Yi”
  \end{itemize}
\item Now normally translated as ``希腊译员'' \cmn{xīlà yìyuán}
  ``Greek Interpreter''

\end{itemize}




%%%
%%% Note 
%%%
% One last thing! In the slides you went through that day on translation, there is a slide about the use of tongues in Chinese. The translation for 七嘴八舌 is actually more accurately defined as 'a lively discussion with everyone talking at once' instead of confusing opinions. It is usually referenced to someone saying something and people having different opinions and discussing them.

% 七 = seven
% 嘴 = mouth
% 八 = eight
% 舌 = tongues

% The idea of seven mouths and eight tongues used in just 4 Chinese
% characters create a sense of lively chatter and discussion amongst a
% group. So although tongues are often used to describe someone in a
% more negative way, I think using 七嘴八舌 to prove the point in  this case may seem a little weird for some of us.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sherlock Holmes reached Japan for the first time in

  abridged Japanese version of "The Man with the Twisted Lip" was
  published in the January issue of a magazine "Nippon-jin",
  translated from a French translation by Maurice LeBlanc.
\item  In April 1899, the newspaper "Mainichi Shinbun" began a
  three-month series featuring an adaptation (by unknown translator)
  of"A Study in Scarlet"
\item Between 12 July and 4 November of the same year, the "Chuo
  Shinbun" newspaper published the first complete Japanese translation
  of a Holmes story, ``The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'', in a
  translation by Gaishi Nan-yo.
\item The first book-length translation appeared in 1907.
\end{itemize} 

\myslide{Sherlock Holmes in Japan}

  Japan, translated Sherlock Holmes stories are in the top five titles which are most often read or requested.
