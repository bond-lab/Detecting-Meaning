% One last thing! In the slides you went through that day on translation, there is a slide about the use of tongues in Chinese. The translation for 七嘴八舌 is actually more accurately defined as 'a lively discussion with everyone talking at once' instead of confusing opinions. It is usually referenced to someone saying something and people having different opinions and discussing them.

% 七 = seven
% 嘴 = mouth
% 八 = eight
% 舌 = tongues

% The idea of seven mouths and eight tongues used in just 4 Chinese
% characters create a sense of lively chatter and discussion amongst a
% group. So although tongues are often used to describe someone in a
% more negative way, I think using 七嘴八舌 to prove the point in  this case may seem a little weird for some of us.
